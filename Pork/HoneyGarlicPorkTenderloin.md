This is a simple, tender pork dish that is served slice with a honey garlic sauce. Made in the Instant Pot.
 
# Ingredients

* Pork Tenderloin, about 2 pounds
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 3 tablespoons honey or brown sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon thyme
* 1 tablespoon djon mustard or any mustard
* 1 cup of chicken stock or water
* 1 teaspoon cornstarch, optional
* 1 tablespoon water, optional
* salt and pepper to taste
* oil for searing


# Steps
1. Set Instant Pot to high saute mode and add oil. Heavily salt and pepper the pork. Sear pork on all sides, remove and set aside.
2. Add garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes
3. Add thyme, mustard, chicken stock and honey. You can really make it your own here. Add whatever flavors you like here. You could add some wine, soy sauce, more/different herbs. Chef's choice.
4. When well combined, add pork into the Instant Pot.
5. Cook on the manual setting for 5 minutes and let naturally release for 15 minutes. This is the hardest part. This may seem like a short cook time, but you have the warm up time and then 15 additional minutes as the pressure releases. The natural release is important to keep the pork tender. Cook times might vary based on the size of the pork. Shooting for 145 degrees.
6. Once pork is cooked to desired doneness, set aside and cover for 5-10 minutes to rest before slicing.
7. While the pork is resting, put the instant pot back on high saute. Bring the sauce to a boil. Mix cornstarch and water together separately and pour into the sauce. Stir until it reaches desired thickness. This step is optional. You could just boil and reduce or serve as is
8. Slice pork and spoon sauce over the top to serve.
