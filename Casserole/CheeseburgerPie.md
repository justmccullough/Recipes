# Cheeseburger Pie

A simple weeknight meal that is a go to for our family. I make this all in a carbon steel skillet. You could also brown the beef separately and bake in a 9 inch pie pan
 
# Ingredients
* 1 pound of ground beef
* 1 whole chopped onion
* salt and pepper to taste
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 cup shredded cheese, cheddar is good
* 1/2 cup of "Bisquik"
* 1 cup milk
* 2 eggs
* green onions for garnish

# Steps
1. Combine milk, bisquik, eggs and garlic powder. Let sit while browning beef. Whisk thoroughly so there are no clumps
2. Brown beef and onions in a oven proof skillet, salt and pepper to taste. 2 teaspoons each as a guess
3. Once beef is browned and onions are slightly translucent, turn off heat. Sprinkle cheese over the top
4. Pour over mixture from step 1
5. Bake at 400 for 25-30 minutes until fully set
6. Remove from oven, sprinkle over green onions and serve from skillet
7. Top with favorite burger toppings pickles, mustard, ketchup, bbq, etc
