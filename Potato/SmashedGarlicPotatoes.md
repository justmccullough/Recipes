# Smashed Garlic Potatoes

Easy to make potato dish. Literally whole baby potatoes that are smashed and roasted until crispy.
 
# Ingredients
* 1-2 lbs of whole small potatoes, any variety
* 1/4 cup oil, olive, vegetable, etc
* garlic to taste, fresh or powdered too much powdered garlic might burn though
* salt and pepper to taste

# Steps
1. Boil the potatoes whole unpeeled for 25-30 minutes until easily pierced with a fork
2. Place a few tablesppons of the oil in a baking pan. Line with parchment for even crispier potatoes
3. Place potatoes in the baking pan and smash flat with potato masher or glass
4. Sprinkle with garlic, salt and pepper. I add quite abit, but its your call here
5. Drizzle over the remaining oil
6. Bake at 425 for 25-30 or until golden and crispy. You can flip them if you want, but its optional.
7. Best served hot out of the oven. They will probably break into smaller pieces when putting them into a dish for serving.
