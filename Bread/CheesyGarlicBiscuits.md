# Cheesy Garlic Biscuits
These are fluffy, cheesy and garlicy. Sort of a copy cat of Red Lobster's biscuits.
 
# Ingredients

* 3 cups flour. You could also use a biscuit mix here
* 3 teaspoons baking powder. Leave out if using a biscuit mix
* 1 tablespoon sugar
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 teaspoon cream of tarter - I know this is old timey but is makes them super fluffy. Optional though or you could add more baking powder
* 1/2 cup of cold butter, cubed
* 1 cup of shredded cheese, sharp cheddar is good
* 1 1/4 cup of milk
* 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, optional for buttermilk flavor in biscuits
* 2 tablespoons of melted butter
* garlic powder, salt and/or garlic salt to sprinkle on top of the biscuits after baking


# Steps
1. Whisk or sift flour, baking powder, sugar, garlic powder, salt and cream of tarter(optional)
2. Cut in the cubed butter with a pastry blade or by hand. Mixture should crumble
3. Put lemob juice in the milk briefly stir and pour mixture into the dry ingredients mixing until just combined
4. You could roll these out and cut them, but I find it easier to just use a 1/4 measuring cup and scoop out dough. I form a ball and place on a parchment lined baking sheet
5. Bake at 450 for 18-20 minutes
6. Allow to cool for 1-2 minutes. Brush the tops with butter either putting the garlic powder and salt into the butter or sprinkling on top after brushing the butter. This is an optional step
7. Serve warm. They are much better warm then room temp. Leftovers should go in the fridge. Reheat to serve.
