 A spiced Christmas cookie covered in a simple icing.
 
# Ingredients

## Cookies

* ⅓ cup white sugar
* ¼ cup packed brown sugar
* ¼ cup honey
* 1 tablespoon water
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* ¾ teaspoon ground ginger
* ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
* ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
* ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
* ¼ teaspoon ground cloves
* ⅛ teaspoon ground white pepper
* ½ tablespoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 tablespoons heavy cream
* 1 egg
* 2 1/2 cups flour

## Icing
* 3 cups powdered sugar
* 3 tablespoons lemon juice

# Steps
1. Combine white and brown sugars, honey, water, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, and white pepper in a saucepan. Place over medium heat and whisk until the sugars dissolve and it just starts to simmer, 1 to 2 minutes. Immediately remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
2. Add salt, baking soda, heavy cream, and egg and whisk until thoroughly combined. Add flour and stir together until a dough forms
3. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 1-2 days. This is optional. They can be baked right away.
4. When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
5. Form small dough balls of your preferred size, roughly walnut sized. Work quickly so the dough doesn't heat up. It's best to not resuse a baking pan for these cookies, but certainly ok for cleanup and time purposes.
6. Bake for 9-10 minutes, be careful to not overbake. Allow cookies cool for 20-30 minutes or room temp
7. While the cookies are cooling mix the icing ingredients together to form a thick icing that is slightly runny.
8. Dip each cookie in the icing, place on a wire rack to allow the access to drip off. You can also dry them on wax or parchment paper, but you may end up with globs of icing on the bottom. Not all bad :)
