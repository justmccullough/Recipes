# Cinnamon Rolls

 These things are amazing. Best cinnamon rolls I have ever had. I serve with not super sweet butter cream style frosting. Could use any type of icing or frosting
 
# Ingredients

## Dough

* 1/2 cup melted butter
* 2 cups warm whole milk, 100 degreesish
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 2 1/4 teaspoons yeast
* 5 cups of all-purpose flour, used in 2 parts
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 teaspoons salt

## Filling
* 3/4 cup softened butter
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon cloves

## Frosting
* 1/4 cup shortening
* 1/4 cup butter
* 1 cup powedered sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 tablespoon milk

# Steps
1. In a large bowl, combine milk, butter and sugar
2. Sprinkle yeast over the mixture and let sit for 1 minute. Mixture should still be 100 or so degrees
3. Add 4 cups of flour and gently mix together
4. Cover the bowl and let rise in a warm place for an hour
5. Add 3/4 cup of flour, baking powder and salt
6. Knead dough thorougly
7. Roll out dough to about 1/2 thick
8. Mix filling ingredients togeher and spread over dough
9. Roll up dough to form a log and pinch the seam closed
10. Cut log into 1 1/2 inch pieces
11. Place rolls in a greased baking dish. I like to pack a 9x13 pretty tightly, but anything that will hold them is fine. I prefer them packed close together, but you could back them apart from each other
12. Let rise for 30 minutes. I have left them overnight in the fridge and it worked fine to avoid early morning prep. Allow the rolls to sit out for 30 minutes if left in the fridge.
13. Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Top with frosting while still warm and serve.
