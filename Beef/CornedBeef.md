# Corned Beef

 My own corned beef recipe. This is just for making your own corned beef. This recipe doesn't have curing salt in it, but you could easily replace 1/4 cup of the kosher salt with pink curing salt. This will give it the signature pink color. This recipe produces a brown/gray piece of meat. YOu might have to order online for things like the whole juniper berries and allspice berries
 
# Ingredients

## Spice Mix

* 1 tbsp whole peppercorns
* 1 tbsp whole corriander seeds
* 1 tbsp whole juniper berries
* 1 tbsp whole allspice berries
* 2 tbsp whole cloves, 8ish pieces
* 1 tsp whole mustard seeds
* 1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
* 1 cinnamon stick broken in a few pieces
* 3-4 bay leaves crumbled

## Brine
* 1 gallon water
* 2 cups kosher salt
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 2 tsp ground ginger

## Beef
* 1 4-5 pound beef brisket. I also use various beef roasts. It's not quite the same, but it can be alot cheaper.

# Steps
1. Toast all spice mix ingredients in a pan on medium high heat for 2-3 minutes. DO NOT let them burn. Remove from pan and allow to cool
2. In a large pot, combine 1/2 gallon of water, sugar, salt, ginger and 3/4 of the spice mix into a pot. Heat until sugar and salt are disolved. Remove from heat and add remaining water. Place in the refrigerator and allow to cool compltely.
3. Add brisket to the brine and ensure the meat is fully submersed. You can use a plate or jar of water to push the meat down into the brine
4. Brine for at least 7 days, but no more than 10. The meat can become super salty if more than 10 days. If it is too salty then you can place the meat in fresh water overnight to remove some of the salt
5. Cook on its own for ruebens and corned beef sandwiches or with cabbage, carrots and potates for corned beef and cabbage. Meat should be cooked slowly at a low tempature. 8-10 on low in a crock pot, 3-4 hours covered in an oven at 300 degrees or in an pressure cooker for 90 minutes.
